## Garbage collector in the browser

Using a `WeakMap` in JavaScript offers several key advantages:

- Automatic Memory Management

- No Manual Cleanup Required: Because entries are automatically removed when the key object becomes unreachable, you don't need to manually delete entries to free up memory.
- Prevents Memory Leaks: Unlike Map, which holds strong references to keys and can keep objects in memory indefinitely, WeakMap allows objects to be garbage collected as soon as they are no longer referenced elsewhere, reducing the risk of unintentional memory retention

Just garbage collector in the web browser ;-)

## IndexedDB vs LocalStorage

IndexedDB - everyone knows LocalStorage but there is better alternative

IndexedDB is ideal for offline mode because it allows web applications to store large amounts of structured data directly in the user's browser, enabling full CRUD operations without an internet connection. This means users can interact with the app and access or modify their data while offline, and any changes can be synchronized with the server once connectivity is restored.


```
let openRequest = indexedDB.open("store", 1);

openRequest.onupgradeneeded = function() {
  // triggers if the client had no database
  // ...perform initialization...
};

openRequest.onerror = function() {
  console.error("Error", openRequest.error);
};

openRequest.onsuccess = function() {
  let db = openRequest.result;
  // continue working with database using db object
};
```
