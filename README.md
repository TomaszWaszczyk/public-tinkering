## Unmount

```
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // This code runs when the component mounts

    return () => {
      // This code runs when the component unmounts
      console.log('Component is unmounting!');
      // Call your cleanup function here
    };
  }, []); // Empty dependency array ensures it runs only on mount/unmount

  return <div>Hello!</div>;
}

export default MyComponent;
```

## Virtualization

Virtualization is a widely used performance technique in React for efficiently rendering large lists, tables, or grids. Virtualization (also called windowing) works by only rendering the items that are currently visible in the viewport, plus a small buffer, instead of rendering every item in a large dataset at once. This dramatically reduces the number of DOM nodes, improves rendering speed, lowers memory usage, and results in smoother scrolling and better overall app responsiveness

```
import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

const Row = ({ index, style }) => (
  <div style={style}>Row {index}</div>
);

const Example = () => (
  <List
    height={150}
    itemCount={1000}
    itemSize={35}
    width={300}
  >
    {Row}
  </List>
);
```

## Hydration

ReactJS hydrates HTML, but what does it mean?

When using server side rendering, the server generates and sends fully rendered HTML to the browser. This allows users to see the content quickly, but initially, this HTML is "static" â€” it does not respond to user interactions because the JavaScript logic and event handlers are not yet active.

Once the browser loads the necessary JavaScript, React "hydrates" the existing HTML. This means React attaches its event listeners and internal state to the already-rendered DOM nodes, transforming the static page into a fully interactive React application.

Hydration is different from a full client-side render, where React would create the DOM from scratch. Instead, hydration reuses the server-rendered HTML and simply "activates" it with interactivity



## Garbage collector in the browser

Using a `WeakMap` in JavaScript offers several key advantages:

- Automatic Memory Management

- No Manual Cleanup Required: Because entries are automatically removed when the key object becomes unreachable, you don't need to manually delete entries to free up memory.
- Prevents Memory Leaks: Unlike Map, which holds strong references to keys and can keep objects in memory indefinitely, WeakMap allows objects to be garbage collected as soon as they are no longer referenced elsewhere, reducing the risk of unintentional memory retention

Just garbage collector in a web browser ;-)

## IndexedDB vs LocalStorage

IndexedDB - everyone knows LocalStorage but there is better alternative

IndexedDB is ideal for offline mode because it allows web applications to store large amounts of structured data directly in the user's browser, enabling full CRUD operations without an internet connection. This means users can interact with the app and access or modify their data while offline, and any changes can be synchronized with the server once connectivity is restored.


```
let openRequest = indexedDB.open("store", 1);

openRequest.onupgradeneeded = function() {
  // triggers if the client had no database
  // ...perform initialization...
};

openRequest.onerror = function() {
  console.error("Error", openRequest.error);
};

openRequest.onsuccess = function() {
  let db = openRequest.result;
  // continue working with database using db object
};
```
