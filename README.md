## IndexedDB vs LocalStorage

IndexedDB - everyone knows LocalStorage but there is better alternative

IndexedDB is ideal for offline mode because it allows web applications to store large amounts of structured data directly in the user's browser, enabling full CRUD operations without an internet connection. This means users can interact with the app and access or modify their data while offline, and any changes can be synchronized with the server once connectivity is restored.


```
let openRequest = indexedDB.open("store", 1);

openRequest.onupgradeneeded = function() {
  // triggers if the client had no database
  // ...perform initialization...
};

openRequest.onerror = function() {
  console.error("Error", openRequest.error);
};

openRequest.onsuccess = function() {
  let db = openRequest.result;
  // continue working with database using db object
};
```
