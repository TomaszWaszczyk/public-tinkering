I share my technical learning publicly to deepen my understanding, help others, and connect with the community. Public learning invites feedback, collaboration, and faster growth for everyone involved.

## IndexedDB vs LocalStorage

```
let openRequest = indexedDB.open("store", 1);

openRequest.onupgradeneeded = function() {
  // triggers if the client had no database
  // ...perform initialization...
};

openRequest.onerror = function() {
  console.error("Error", openRequest.error);
};

openRequest.onsuccess = function() {
  let db = openRequest.result;
  // continue working with database using db object
};
```
